# Know the Difference Between Projects, Programs and Portfolios  

Projects continue to generate valueâ€”solving user problems, promoting technological advancement, meeting compliance requirements, and gaining a competitive edge. 
Projects have a specific goal, a one-time undertaking, and are performed and managed for a fixed period with a particular start and end date. 
A project may be the delivery of a service or product on time and budget with required performance benchmarks. 
For example, the implementation of a new customer relationship system may generate more new leads and, therefore, more revenue.
